INTRODUCTION

Welcome to my first machine learning project! The primary objective of this project is to predict prices using machine learning techniques. I have conducted a basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset and implemented three different models. The goal is to compare these models and determine the best-performing one for price prediction.
